Explanation of the Java Digital Clock:




1. We use Java Swing to build a simple GUI window.
2. A JLabel is used to display the current time in the format HH:mm:ss.
3. A Timer is set up to refresh the label every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
4. The SimpleDateFormat class formats the current time to display in hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. The updateClock() method fetches the current time and updates the label.
6. The constructor sets up the frame, initializes the timer, and makes the frame visible.
This is a clean and beginner-friendly implementation that demonstrates the use of GUI components and
timers in Java.
